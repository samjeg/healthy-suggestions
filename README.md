*** Healthy Recipes ***

Requirements:
- React.js
- Node.js 
- React Dom


This is a website on the topic of healthy recipes. Which is currently being creacted using the react js front-end framework.
So far the data is not retrieved directly from an API. Instead I am retreiving the data from a website by building a webscraper. see code in the following link -> https://github.com/samjeg/WebScraping 

Currently working on the webscraper to get the data for the recipes detail page. 

In the future, I plan to build and deploy an API using this data. So I can retrieve data directly from the API instead.
